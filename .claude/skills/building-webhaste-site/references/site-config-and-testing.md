# Site Config, Build Step, and Testing

## Read `.webhaste/site.config.json` before writing markup

Don't assume Bootstrap, `<p>` paragraphs, etc. — they're configurable per
site and change over time. Check this file first:

- `cssFramework` — `bootstrap5`, `tailwind`, or `none`. Write class names
  that match whichever is active; classes for the wrong framework are dead
  weight (or actively wrong) in the published output. This only controls
  which class names nav menus render with — it does NOT pull in the
  framework's actual CSS/JS; that has to be a real `<link>`/`<script>` tag
  in the template's `<head>` (or absent, if `cssFramework` and the template
  markup have drifted apart — check the template itself, not just this
  file, before assuming a framework is actually loaded).
- `paragraphMode` — `p` or `div`. Matches how the visual editor's Enter key
  behaves; hand-written content should follow the same convention so it's
  consistent with what a human editing the same page would produce.
- `activeTemplate` — which template file wraps pages by default (see
  references/pages-and-templates.md for per-page overrides).
- `deploymentTarget` / `deployDirectory` — where "Publish" sends the site.
  Not usually relevant to content edits, but useful context if asked about
  publishing.
- `domain` — the live site's URL (e.g. `https://example.com`). Drives
  `sitemap.xml` generation (see references/seo-and-search.md); no sitemap
  is produced while it's unset.
- `language` — a BCP 47 tag (e.g. `en`, `pt-BR`) that fills the template's
  `{{LANG}}` placeholder for every page site-wide. Individual pages can
  override this — see references/navigation-and-metadata.md.
- `schemaMarkup` — Organization/LocalBusiness JSON-LD injected into
  `index.html` only when both `type` and `name` are set. See
  references/seo-and-search.md — don't hand-write your own
  Organization/LocalBusiness `<script type="application/ld+json">` in a
  page's Header code field, it would duplicate this.

The same "no CDN `<script>` in preview" limitation applies to icon
libraries (Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome, etc.) added to the template's
`<head>`: prefer the **CSS + webfont** `<link>` they offer over a JS
"kit"/SVG-injection snippet (e.g. Font Awesome's
`kit.fontawesome.com/....js`) — the CSS form is just a stylesheet and
renders fine in WebHaste's preview, while the JS form silently shows no
icons while editing (it would still work once published, but there's no
way to tell that from preview alone).

## No package manager or build step

There's no `package.json`, no `node_modules`, and nothing to `npm install`
— WebHaste never scaffolds any of that into a project (the one exception
is `cssFramework: "tailwind"`, which scaffolds `package.json` +
`tailwind-input.css` + `scripts/custom.css` specifically for compiling
Tailwind's CSS — still nothing else to install). `.webhaste/compose.js` is
a self-contained, dependency-free Node script; running it is the only
"tooling" this repo has. Don't add a `package.json` or install dependencies
for a task unless the user explicitly asks for build tooling beyond what
WebHaste itself provides.

## Testing your changes (requires Node)

Page files are fragments (see references/pages-and-templates.md), so you
can't just open one in a browser to see the real result — it needs the
template/nav/CSS-framework substitution applied first.
`.webhaste/compose.js` does exactly that, headlessly, matching what the
extension's "Render to Local Folder" / Publish would produce:

```
node .webhaste/compose.js --out .agent-preview
```

This writes fully-composed pages (plus `assets/`/`scripts/`) into
`.agent-preview/` inside the project — use a scratch `--out` folder like
this rather than the real `dist/` (or whatever `deployDirectory` is set
to) so you don't clobber the site owner's actual build output. Delete the
scratch folder once you're done checking it; it's not meant to be
committed. Add `--packaged` to match what the **Packaged** deployment
target produces instead (root-relative paths rewritten to `../`-relative
ones, search data embedded per page, `sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt`/
`404.html` omitted) — useful for checking a page opens correctly via
`file://` without installing the extension. Run
`node .webhaste/compose.js --help` for the full option list.

If Node isn't available in this environment, fall back to reasoning from
the template's placeholders and this skill's conventions — there's no
other way to render a page outside the extension itself.

## Do not hand-edit

- `dist/` (or whatever `deployDirectory` points at) — build output from
  "Render to Local Folder," overwritten on every render. WebHaste doesn't
  scaffold a `.gitignore` entry for it, so some projects end up committing
  `dist/` to version control anyway — if so, expect its diffs to show up
  in `git status` after every render; that's expected noise from the
  build, not something to investigate or hand-fix.
- `.webhaste/compose.js`, `.webhaste/compose-core.js`, and
  `.webhaste/block-library.md` — regenerated every time the project
  folder is opened in the editor, so hand edits won't stick. (Unlike
  `CLAUDE.md`, this skill, and `.webhaste/templates/`, which are copied in
  once and then left alone — edit those freely.)
- `sitemap.xml` and `search-index.json` — regenerated on every
  publish/render; see references/seo-and-search.md.
- `.webhaste/` config files (`site.config.json`, `nav.json`, `pages.json`)
  are fine to hand-edit — that's the supported way to bulk-edit them — but
  keep the JSON valid. The editor doesn't validate on load, and a broken
  file falls back to defaults silently rather than erroring.
