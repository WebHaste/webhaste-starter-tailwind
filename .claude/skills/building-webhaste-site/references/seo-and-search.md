# SEO, Sitemap, Robots, and Site Search

## sitemap.xml and robots.txt

`sitemap.xml` is generated automatically at publish/render time from
`site.config.json`'s `domain` and every non-draft page — don't create or
hand-edit one in the project root, it plays no part in composing it. For
"Render to Local Folder" it lands inside the deploy folder (`dist/` by
default); for Cloudflare/Netlify Publish it's uploaded straight to the
live site and never touches a file here at all. If `domain` is unset, no
sitemap is produced.

`robots.txt`, by contrast, is a real project file at the root, scaffolded
once with a permissive default (`User-agent: *` / `Allow: /`) and never
regenerated — safe to hand-edit (e.g. adding `Disallow:` rules) same as
any other file here.

Neither is produced by the **Packaged** deployment target — a site
rendered for opening straight from disk has no real domain or server, so
a sitemap/robots file would serve no purpose there.

## Site search

`search-index.json` is generated automatically alongside `sitemap.xml` at
publish/render time — same rules, don't hand-edit or create one at the
project root. Each entry is built from a page's *raw* content (not the
composed output, so template nav/header/footer text is never duplicated
into every page's indexed text), plus its `pages.json` title/description.

Two files are already scaffolded into `scripts/` for you — `search.js`
(the search UI logic) and `lunr.min.js` (the search library it depends
on) — but neither does anything until your template actually references
them and includes a search box. Add to the layout template's `<head>`:

```html
<script src="/scripts/lunr.min.js"></script>
<script src="/scripts/search.js"></script>
```

and a search box wherever you want one to appear:

```html
<input type="search" id="cs-search-input" placeholder="Search...">
<div id="cs-search-results"></div>
```

`search.js` looks for those two element IDs specifically and wires itself
up automatically — nothing else to configure, and a template that never
adds them just doesn't load the index. Results render as
`<ul class="cs-search-list"><li class="cs-search-item">` entries (or a
`<p class="cs-search-empty">` when there are none) — unstyled by default,
so add CSS for those classes the same way you would for any other `cs-*`
class from a block or menu.

Search still works when the site is rendered with the **Packaged**
deployment target (for handing off a site that has to open straight from
disk, no server) — it just works differently under the hood. Chrome blocks
`fetch()` of a local file under `file://` regardless of path, so instead of
a separate `search-index.json` fetched at runtime, each page gets its own
copy of the index embedded inline, with every result link already pointing
at the right relative path for that page. Nothing about writing pages or
using the search box changes — this is purely a render-time difference.

## Per-page SEO/search checkboxes

Page Properties has three checkboxes independent of Draft status — a page
with any of them checked still publishes normally, it's just left out of
the file(s) named:

- **Exclude from sitemap.xml** — leaves it out of `sitemap.xml`.
- **Exclude from site search** — leaves it out of `search-index.json`.
- **Hide from search engines (noindex)** — adds a real
  `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` tag to the page. Unlike the
  two checkboxes above, which only control WebHaste's own generated
  files, this is a genuine signal to crawlers — deliberately not a
  `robots.txt` `Disallow` rule instead, since `Disallow` blocks crawling
  rather than indexing, which works against a `noindex` tag a crawler
  can't see on a page it's blocked from fetching in the first place.

## Open Graph / Twitter Card tags are automatic

Every page gets `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`, `og:site_name`,
`og:url`, `twitter:card`, `twitter:title`, and `twitter:description`
injected automatically at publish/render time, built from that same
page's `pages.json` title/description — nothing to opt into, no
placeholder to add to the template. `og:description`/
`twitter:description` are simply omitted for a page with no meta
description, and `og:url` is omitted entirely when `site.config.json` →
`domain` is unset. There's no `og:image` — no per-page "social image"
field exists yet. Don't hand-write your own `og:*`/`twitter:*` tags in a
page's Header code field (references/pages-and-templates.md) — they'd
duplicate the auto-generated ones.

## Schema Markup (Organization / LocalBusiness) is configured, not templated

If `site.config.json` → `schemaMarkup` has a `type` and `name` set, a
`<script type="application/ld+json">` tag describing the site as an
Organization or LocalBusiness is injected automatically into `index.html`
only — set via the extension's Site Settings dialog, not a template
placeholder. Don't hand-write your own Organization/LocalBusiness JSON-LD in
a page's Header code field — it would duplicate the auto-generated one.
Header code is still the right place for schema types this feature doesn't
cover (Article, Product, FAQPage, Event, etc.) or for schema on a page
other than the homepage.
