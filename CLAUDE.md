# Working on this site

This is a WebHaste project: content edited here is meant to be opened and
published through the WebHaste Chrome extension, not built with a
bundler/framework of its own. A few things about the format aren't obvious
from the files alone — read this before creating or editing pages.

The same conventions are also available as the `building-webhaste-site`
skill under `.claude/skills/` — a shorter workflow index plus topic-scoped
reference files, for tooling that can load just the part it needs instead
of this whole document. Both describe the same project; if they ever
disagree, this file is the one more likely to have been hand-edited for
this specific site.

## Page files are content fragments, not full HTML documents

Every `*.html` file at the project root (e.g. `index.html`, `docs.html`) is
just the **body content** for that page — a fragment, not a full
`<html><head>...` document. Don't add `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, or
`<body>` tags to a page file; the active layout template supplies all of
that at publish/preview time by substituting `{{CONTENT}}` with the page
file's contents.

The current layout template is `.webhaste/templates/<activeTemplate>`
(see `.webhaste/site.config.json` → `activeTemplate` for which file).
It also defines `{{TITLE}}`, `{{META_DESCRIPTION}}`, `{{NAV:<menu>}}`,
`{{SITE_NAME}}`, `{{LANG}}`, and `{{YEAR}}` placeholders — check that file
if you need to know what wraps every page (header/nav/footer). `{{LANG}}`
fills the `<html lang="...">` attribute; see "Multi-language content"
below for where its value comes from. Any CSS framework
`<link>`/`<script>` tags are NOT a placeholder — they're literal markup in
the template's `<head>`, same as `scripts/styles.css`/`main.js`; WebHaste
doesn't inject or manage them.

## Read `.webhaste/site.config.json` before writing markup

Don't assume Bootstrap, `<p>` paragraphs, etc. — they're configurable per
site and change over time. Check this file first:

- `cssFramework` — `bootstrap5`, `tailwind`, or `none`. Write class names
  that match whichever is active (this site: `tailwind`). WebHaste itself
  never loads the framework's CSS/JS — that has to be a real `<link>`/
  `<script>` in the template's `<head>`, same as any other asset. This site
  specifically loads Tailwind via a **precompiled** `scripts/styles.css`
  (`<link href="/scripts/styles.css">` in `template.html`), not Tailwind's
  CDN "browser build" script — that script tag gets blocked by WebHaste's
  own extension CSP inside the preview iframe (blocks any `<script src>`
  not bundled in the extension), so nothing would render in preview even
  though it'd work once actually published. See "Tailwind build step"
  below before touching CSS on this project.

  The same "no CDN `<script>` in preview" limitation applies to icon
  libraries (Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome, etc.): prefer the **CSS +
  webfont** `<link>` they offer over a JS "kit"/SVG-injection snippet
  (e.g. Font Awesome's `kit.fontawesome.com/....js`) — the CSS form is
  just a stylesheet and renders fine in WebHaste's preview, while the JS
  form silently shows no icons while editing (it would still work once
  published, but there's no way to tell that from preview alone).
- `paragraphMode` — `p` or `div`. Matches how the visual editor's Enter key
  behaves; hand-written content should follow the same convention so it's
  consistent with what a human editing the same page would produce.
- `activeTemplate` — which template file wraps pages (see above).
- `deploymentTarget` / `deployDirectory` — where "Publish" sends the site.
  Not usually relevant to content edits, but useful context if asked about
  publishing.
- `domain` — the live site's URL (e.g. `https://example.com`). Drives
  `sitemap.xml` generation (see below); no sitemap is produced while it's
  unset.
- `language` — a BCP 47 tag (e.g. `en`, `pt-BR`) that fills the template's
  `{{LANG}}` placeholder for every page site-wide. Individual pages can
  override this — see "Multi-language content" below.

## Making a new page reachable

Creating `some-page.html` at the root is not enough by itself — nothing
links to it. Two more files, both in `.webhaste/`:

- **`nav.json`** — add an entry to the relevant menu (commonly `header` or
  `footer`) so it's linked from the site chrome. Supports nested `children`
  for dropdowns, e.g.:
  ```json
  { "label": "New Page", "href": "/some-page.html" }
  ```
  A top-level `"layouts"` map controls how a whole menu renders: each key is
  a menu name, value is `"navbar"` (default, horizontal) or `"columns"`
  (each top-level item becomes a heading with its `children` listed below
  it — typical for a multi-column footer). E.g. `"layouts": { "footer":
  "columns" }` (this site's actual setting — see `.webhaste/nav.json`).
  Every rendered menu also gets `cs-menu cs-menu-<name>` classes (e.g.
  `cs-menu-header`, `cs-menu-footer`) regardless of layout, so you can
  target a specific menu in site CSS.
- **`pages.json`** (optional) — per-page `<title>`/meta description
  override, keyed by filename:
  ```json
  "some-page.html": { "title": "New Page", "description": "..." }
  ```
  A page without an entry here falls back to a default title built from the
  file name and site name — fine for minor pages, worth setting explicitly
  for anything meant to be found via search or shared as a link. Unlike
  `site.config.json`/`nav.json`, this file is *not* scaffolded up front —
  it's created the first time something needs a title/description override.
  Don't assume it exists; check before reading or editing it.

  A page entry can also carry `"status": "draft"` (set from the Page
  Properties dialog's Status field; the key is omitted entirely for the
  default "Active" state). A draft page stays on disk and still previews
  normally in the editor, but is skipped by Publish, Render to Local
  Folder, and `sitemap.xml` — treat it as work in progress, not a live URL,
  when deciding whether to link to it from `nav.json` or other pages.

  A page entry can also carry `"language"` — a BCP 47 tag overriding
  `site.config.json`'s site-wide `language` for just that page (e.g. a
  single Spanish-language page on an otherwise English site). Omitted key
  means "inherit the site default," same pattern as `status`.

  A page entry can also carry `"template"` — a filename under
  `.webhaste/templates/` overriding `site.config.json`'s `activeTemplate`
  for just that page (e.g. every page under `blog/` using a
  `blog-layout.html` that adds a byline/date block the rest of the site
  doesn't have). Same "omitted key means inherit the site default" pattern
  as `status`/`language` above; set from the Page Properties dialog's
  Template dropdown, not something to hand-author unless you're also adding
  the template file itself under `.webhaste/templates/`.

  A page entry can also carry `"headCode"` — raw HTML/JS inserted verbatim
  before `</head>` for just that page (set from the Page Properties
  dialog's "Header code" field), for things a sitewide snippet in the
  template can't cover — e.g. a Google Ads/Analytics *conversion* tag that
  only applies to one page. For several/changing tags, prefer putting a
  Google Tag Manager container snippet in the template instead and managing
  tags in GTM's own UI, rather than hand-editing this field per page.

## `assets/` and `scripts/` are flat — no subfolders

Both directories are read one level deep only; WebHaste does not walk
subdirectories when composing pages. A file at `assets/photo.jpg` works —
`assets/uploads/2024/01/photo.jpg` does not. A nested file isn't just
missed by the Assets dialog: it fails silently everywhere —

- It won't render in the editor's live preview (shows as a broken
  image/missing stylesheet, with no error explaining why).
- It's excluded from Publish (Cloudflare/Netlify) and from Render to Local
  Folder/Packaged, so the live site 404s on it — even though the file is
  sitting right there in the project folder and looks fine in `git status`.

This matters most when importing/converting an existing site (e.g. a
WordPress export, which nests uploads as `wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/...`
by convention): flatten every file straight into `assets/` (or `scripts/`
for JS/CSS) and rewrite every `src`/`href` reference to match — don't
preserve the source site's folder structure. Watch for filename collisions
across what were previously separate folders (rename to disambiguate, e.g.
`photo-2023.jpg` vs `photo-2024.jpg`), and for any stylesheet among the
files that itself references sibling assets by relative path (e.g. an icon
font's `@font-face` pointing at `../fonts/name.woff2`) — those internal
paths need rewriting too once the file they're relative to moves.
(Page files themselves don't have this restriction — `blog/post.html` is
fine — this only applies to `assets/`/`scripts/`.)

## Template-level files go in `elements/`, not `assets/`

`assets/` is what the editor's Assets dialog lists — it's for content a site
owner inserts into pages, so anything dumped there looks like something an
editor might pick. Files that only the *template or stylesheets* use belong
in **`elements/`**: a published, flat folder with no editor UI. That means
web fonts (`.woff2`, `.woff`, `.ttf`), icon-font files, the site logo,
favicon, CSS background images, and decorative shapes/textures referenced by
a stylesheet or the template. Reference them as `/elements/<name>` (CSS:
`url(/elements/<name>)`; template: `<img src="/elements/logo.png">`). CSS and
JS stay in `scripts/`. It's created when you add the first file.

Rule of thumb: if a person would reasonably pick it from a media library
while writing a page, it's `assets/`; if removing it would break the
*design* rather than a page's content, it's `elements/`.

## Multi-language content

`{{LANG}}` in the layout template resolves per page as: this page's
`pages.json` → `language` override, else `site.config.json` → `language`,
else `"en"`. There's no separate translated-copy mechanism — a localized
page is just a normal `.html` fragment (e.g. `about-es.html`) written in
that language, linked from `nav.json` like any other page, with its
`pages.json` entry's `language` set to match. `hreflang` alternate-language
`<link>` tags aren't generated automatically; add them by hand in the
template's `<head>` (or per-page, if editing raw HTML) if the site needs
them.

## sitemap.xml and robots.txt

`sitemap.xml` is generated automatically at publish/render time from
`site.config.json`'s `domain` and every non-draft page — don't create or
hand-edit one in the project root, it plays no part in composing it. For
"Render to Local Folder" it lands inside the deploy folder (`dist/` by
default — see that folder's own "don't hand-edit" note below); for
Cloudflare/Netlify Publish it's uploaded straight to the live site and
never touches a file here at all. If `domain` is unset, no sitemap is
produced.

`robots.txt`, by contrast, is a real project file at the root, scaffolded
once with a permissive default (`User-agent: *` / `Allow: /`) and never
regenerated — safe to hand-edit (e.g. adding `Disallow:` rules) same as any
other file here.

Neither is produced by the **Packaged** deployment target (Site Settings →
Deployment Target) — a site rendered for opening straight from disk has no
real domain or server, so a sitemap/robots file would serve no purpose there.

## Site search

`search-index.json` is generated automatically alongside `sitemap.xml` at
publish/render time — same rules, don't hand-edit or create one at the
project root. Each entry is built from a page's *raw* content (not the
composed output, so template nav/header/footer text is never duplicated into
every page's indexed text), plus its `pages.json` title/description.

Two files are already scaffolded into `scripts/` for you — `search.js` (the
search UI logic) and `lunr.min.js` (the search library it depends on) —
but neither does anything until your template actually references them and
includes a search box. Add to the layout template's `<head>`:

```html
<script src="/scripts/lunr.min.js"></script>
<script src="/scripts/search.js"></script>
```

and a search box wherever you want one to appear:

```html
<input type="search" id="cs-search-input" placeholder="Search...">
<div id="cs-search-results"></div>
```

`search.js` looks for those two element IDs specifically and wires itself up
automatically — nothing else to configure, and a template that never adds
them just doesn't load the index. Results render as
`<ul class="cs-search-list"><li class="cs-search-item">` entries (or a
`<p class="cs-search-empty">` when there are none) — unstyled by default, so
add CSS for those classes the same way you would for any other `cs-*` class
from a block or menu.

Page Properties has three checkboxes independent of Draft status — a page
with any of them checked still publishes normally, it's just left out of the
file(s) named:

- **Exclude from sitemap.xml** — leaves it out of `sitemap.xml`.
- **Exclude from site search** — leaves it out of `search-index.json`.
- **Hide from search engines (noindex)** — adds a real
  `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` tag to the page. Unlike the two
  checkboxes above, which only control WebHaste's own generated files, this
  is a genuine signal to crawlers.

Search still works when the site is rendered with the **Packaged**
deployment target (for handing off a site that has to open straight from
disk, no server) — it just works differently under the hood. Chrome blocks
`fetch()` of a local file under `file://` regardless of path, so instead of
a separate `search-index.json` fetched at runtime, each page gets its own
copy of the index embedded inline, with every result link already pointing
at the right relative path for that page. Nothing about writing pages or
using the search box changes — this is purely a render-time difference.

## Lottie/JSON animations

The Blocks dialog's "Lottie Animation" block wires an uploaded Lottie/
Bodymovin `.json` export into a page via a `data-lottie-src="/assets/
your-file.json"` attribute — same `assets/` upload path as an image, since
the Assets dialog treats `.json` as a third asset kind alongside images and
PDFs. Two files are already scaffolded into `scripts/` for you, same
never-overwritten pattern as `search.js`/`lunr.min.js` above —
`lottie.min.js` (the player library) and `lottie-init.js` (this site's glue
that finds every `[data-lottie-src]` element on the page and plays it).
Neither does anything until the template actually references both:

```html
<script src="/scripts/lottie.min.js"></script>
<script src="/scripts/lottie-init.js"></script>
```

**The block only ever shows a static placeholder in the WebHaste editor** —
in Visual view and in live Preview alike — never the real animation. This
is deliberate, not a bug to chase: `scripts/*.js` can't execute inside the
preview iframe at all (the same `script-src 'self'` restriction that
already blocks a site's own `scripts/main.js` there), so there was never a
way to render the actual animation short of a much larger CSP workaround.
The real animation only appears on the published site, or a "Render to
Local Folder"/"Packaged" build opened in a normal browser tab — check it
there, not in WebHaste's own preview.

Animations still work fully offline under the **Packaged** deployment
target (no server, opened straight from disk) — same as site search: each
page gets its referenced animation's actual JSON embedded inline instead of
`lottie-init.js` fetching it, since `file://` pages can't fetch anything.
Nothing to configure for this; it's automatic whenever a page has a Lottie
block, same as the search embedding above.

## Lists

The Blocks dialog's "List: Links", "List: Directory", and "List: Table"
blocks render an admin-managed list — set up from the toolbar's Site Admin
→ 🗂️ Lists dialog (fields, sort order, optional pagination, and the
entries themselves) — into a page. Each inserted block is a placeholder
wired to one specific list via a `data-list-src="/lists/<slug>.json"`
attribute (set from the block's own 🗂️ toolbar button, not hand-typed),
plus `data-list-view="links"`, `"directory"`, or `"table"`.

**"List: Table" is structurally different from the other two**: its
placeholder *is* a real `<table>` element (with real `<thead>`/`<tbody>`
inside), not a `<div>` — list.js only ever repopulates the head/body rows,
never touches the `<table>` tag's own attributes. That's what makes the
table's `class` genuinely yours to edit: it starts out as `class="table"`
(Bootstrap 5) or `class="table-auto"` (Tailwind, **this site's default**)
— that framework's own default table styling, picked automatically to
match `cssFramework` — but it's plain markup in the block's source,
editable in Code view exactly like any other block's classes (add
`table-striped`, swap it for something else, or remove it entirely).
There's no dedicated dialog for this one, the same way hand-tuning a
block's wrapper classes elsewhere in this doc is "still a Code view edit"
— the ⚙ cog only edits `<div>` wrappers, not a `<table>` itself.

**A site's template must load `scripts/list.js` for a List block to
render at all** — same never-auto-injected pattern as
`search.js`/`lottie-init.js` above, and the single most common way this
feature looks broken: the placeholder (icon + list name) is exactly what
renders on the live, published site if this script tag is missing, not
just a symptom you'd only see in the editor. Add it to the template's
`<head>`:

```html
<script src="/scripts/list.js"></script>
```

Field types drive how a value renders, across all three placements: a
`link` field becomes a real `<a href>` (its value supplies the destination
— for "List: Links" specifically, it's also what makes the *whole entry*
clickable, with every other non-image field's value as the link text), an
`image` field becomes a real `<img src>`, and a `date`/`text` field renders
as plain, human-readable text — a `date` value (stored as `yyyy-mm-dd`) is
reformatted for display as e.g. "Sept. 28, 2026", never shown in its raw
stored form. Every rendered field gets a `cs-list-field cs-list-field--
<type>` class (plus `cs-list-item` on each entry's wrapper, and
`cs-list--links`/`cs-list--directory` on the container) to style from
site CSS, same `cs-*` convention as site search's result classes — except
"List: Table", which renders plain `<th>`/`<td>` with no extra classes at
all, since a real `<table>`'s own row/cell semantics are already what
you'd style directly (a field's label becomes the `<th>` text, in field
order; link/image fields still render as a real `<a>`/`<img>` inside their
`<td>`, just without a wrapping class to hook).

**Only lists actually placed on some page get published** — an admin can
fill in a list's entries well before deciding where, or whether, to place
it on a page, so an unreferenced list's data deliberately never gets
copied out to a public `/lists/<slug>.json` URL at Publish/Render time.
Placing a block, publishing, then later removing that block from every
page stops that list from being republished on the *next* publish — it
isn't retroactively deleted from a deployment that already shipped it.

**The block only ever shows a static placeholder in the WebHaste editor**
— in Visual view and in live Preview alike — same reasoning as the Lottie
block above (`scripts/*.js` can't execute inside the preview iframe's
`script-src 'self'` CSP). Check a real list's rendering on the published
site, or a "Render to Local Folder"/"Packaged" build opened in a normal
browser tab.

Lists still work fully offline under the **Packaged** deployment target
(no server, opened straight from disk) — same as site search and Lottie: a
real `/lists/<slug>.json` file can't be `fetch()`'d under `file://`
(blocked by CORS regardless of path form), so each page gets its
referenced list's actual data embedded inline instead of `list.js`
fetching it. Nothing to configure for this; it's automatic whenever a page
has a List block.

Pagination (when turned on for a list) is entirely client-side — there's
no separate URL/page-number per page of results, by design, not as a
current limitation: a generated static page per page-number would need
its own SEO handling (a list's real "page 2" isn't a page anything should
link to or index), and `sitemap.xml` already covers whatever real pages
link into a list. The current page is tracked as a `?list_<slug>_page=N`
query parameter (via `history.replaceState`, so it's still bookmarkable)
rather than changing what's actually served. For "List: Table" specifically,
the Previous/Next controls render as a sibling element right after the
`</table>` rather than inside it — a `<div>` can never be a valid direct
child of `<table>`, so there's nowhere inside the table itself for them to
go.

### Running your own JavaScript after a list renders

Rows are built in the visitor's browser, so a script that acts on a finished
list must wait for it. After every draw, for all three views, `list.js`
fires a bubbling `cs-list-rendered` event on the list's `[data-list-src]`
element (for "List: Table", the `<table>`) and sets
`data-list-rendered="true"` on it. `event.detail` is `{ src, view, page,
pageCount, entries, list }` — `entries` are the rows just drawn, `list` the
whole parsed list.

```js
document.addEventListener("cs-list-rendered", function (e) { /* e.target, e.detail */ });
```

It fires again on every Previous/Next redraw, so guard one-time setup.
Register the listener before `DOMContentLoaded` (a `<head>` script, an
end-of-body script, or `defer`): in a Packaged build the data is embedded, so
the first render is synchronous at `DOMContentLoaded` and a later listener
misses it — a late script should check
`el.hasAttribute("data-list-rendered")` first. Needs a `scripts/list.js` that
has the event; it's copy-once, so a project scaffolded earlier has an older
copy (`grep -c cs-list-rendered scripts/list.js` returns `0`).

### Optional: DataTables on a "List: Table"

WebHaste doesn't bundle or inject DataTables (same no-framework-injection
rule as everything else here), but a "List: Table" block is a real
`<table>` with real `<thead>`/`<tbody>`, so a site that wants client-side
search/sort/paging can add it itself. Three pieces, all in the site, none
in WebHaste:

1. DataTables' CSS + JS in the template's `<head>`, after `list.js`
   (DataTables 3.x needs no jQuery — the 3.1.2 build's UMD wrapper has no
   dependencies; the 2.x line's standard `<script>` build did require it, so
   don't copy a 2.x snippet. Check datatables.net for the current version):
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.datatables.net/3.1.2/css/dataTables.dataTables.min.css">
   <script src="https://cdn.datatables.net/3.1.2/js/dataTables.min.js" defer></script>
   ```
2. An `id` on the block's `<table>` in Code view (e.g. `id="shows-table"`);
   leave `data-list-src`/`data-list-view` alone.
3. An init script that waits for the list to render — **don't** call
   `new DataTable()` on page load: on a served site the rows aren't there
   yet, so DataTables would initialize against the one-row placeholder. With
   a current `scripts/list.js`, use the `cs-list-rendered` event (see
   "Running your own JavaScript after a list renders" above); it works in
   served and Packaged builds and needs no `id`:
   ```html
   <script>
   document.addEventListener("cs-list-rendered", function (e) {
     var table = e.target;
     if (table.tagName !== "TABLE" || table.dataset.dt) return;
     table.dataset.dt = "1"; // draw can fire again; init once
     new DataTable(table, { order: [] }); // [] keeps the list's own sort
   });
   </script>
   ```
   For an older `scripts/list.js` with no event, check first and then watch
   instead:
   ```html
   <script>
   document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
     var table = document.getElementById("shows-table");
     if (!table) return;
     var tbody = table.querySelector("tbody");
     function start() {
       if (tbody.querySelector(".cs-list-placeholder-cell")) return false;
       new DataTable(table, { order: [] }); // [] keeps the list's own sort
       return true;
     }
     if (!start()) {
       var obs = new MutationObserver(function () {
         if (start()) obs.disconnect();
       });
       obs.observe(tbody, { childList: true });
     }
   });
   </script>
   ```
   Check first, then watch: in a Packaged (`file://`) build the list's data
   is embedded, so the rows already exist at `DOMContentLoaded` and an
   observer alone would never fire.

Turn **off** the list's own pagination when doing this — list.js's
Previous/Next controls and DataTables' paging would both render, and
list.js rebuilding `<tbody>` on a page change would break DataTables'
internal state. As with every other `scripts/*.js` here, none of this runs
in the editor's preview iframe (CSP blocks external scripts) — check it in
a Render to Local Folder build or on the published site. A Packaged
(`file://`) build still renders the list, but a CDN-hosted DataTables
needs internet access; vendor the files into `scripts/` for a truly
offline hand-off.

## Open Graph / Twitter Card tags are automatic

Every page gets `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`, `og:site_name`,
`og:url`, `twitter:card`, `twitter:title`, and `twitter:description`
injected automatically at publish/render time, built from that same page's
`pages.json` title/description — no placeholder to add to the template,
nothing to opt into. `og:description`/`twitter:description` are simply
omitted for a page with no meta description, and `og:url` is omitted
entirely when `site.config.json` → `domain` is unset. There's no
`og:image` — no per-page "social image" field exists yet. Don't hand-write
your own `og:*`/`twitter:*` tags in a page's Header code field (see
above) — they'd duplicate the auto-generated ones.

## Schema Markup (Organization / LocalBusiness) is configured, not templated

If `site.config.json` → `schemaMarkup` has a `type` and `name` set, a
`<script type="application/ld+json">` tag describing the site as an
Organization or LocalBusiness is injected automatically into `index.html`
only — set via the extension's Site Settings dialog, not a template
placeholder. Don't hand-write your own Organization/LocalBusiness JSON-LD in
a page's Header code field (see above) — it would duplicate the
auto-generated one. Header code is still the right place for schema types
this feature doesn't cover (Article, Product, FAQPage, Event, etc.) or for
schema on a page other than the homepage.

## Content blocks

Reusable HTML snippets — hero sections, CTAs, embeds, etc. — follow this
wrapper convention when inserted by the editor:

```html
<div id="cs-block-xxxxxxxx" class="cs-block cs-block--<type>">
  ...
</div>
```

The `id` just needs to be unique on the page; it doesn't need to match any
particular format. If you're writing a section that isn't one-off page
content — something likely to get reused across pages — consider dropping
it in `.webhaste/blocks/<name>.html` as its own file instead of inlining
it. Anything there shows up as an insertable block tile in the editor's
Blocks dialog, labeled from the filename, and can be reused without
duplicating markup by hand. Write just the inner markup in that file —
*not* the `cs-block` wrapper shown above. The wrapper (with a freshly
generated id) is added by the editor at the moment a block is inserted
onto a page, not stored in the block's own source file.

**See `.webhaste/block-library.md`** for the full list of blocks actually
available in this site's Blocks dialog — both the extension's built-in ones
(Hero, CTA, Testimonial, etc., with their real markup for this site's
`cssFramework`) and this site's own custom ones. It's generated, not
hand-written — see "Do not hand-edit" below.

## Tailwind build step (not a normal WebHaste project trait)

WebHaste itself never scaffolds a `package.json` or any build tooling — a
typical project has nothing to `npm install`. **This project is the
exception**: it needs Tailwind CSS compiled ahead of time, so it carries a
real `package.json`, `node_modules` (gitignored), and one build step. Don't
assume other WebHaste projects have this; don't add build tooling to a
project that doesn't already have it unless the user explicitly asks.

- **`tailwind-input.css`** (project root) is the real source of truth:
  `@import "tailwindcss";`, this site's brand color theme (`@theme` block —
  `brand`, `ink`, `muted`, `surface`, etc.), a `@layer components` block
  with a few reusable button classes (`wh-btn`, `wh-btn-primary`,
  `wh-btn-outline`, `wh-btn-soft` — stand-ins for what would have been
  Bootstrap's `btn`/`btn-primary`/etc.), plus some hand-written CSS carried
  over from before this site had a `custom.css` (below) to put it in.
- **`scripts/custom.css`** is where *new* hand-written CSS classes belong —
  a plain, non-generated stylesheet, not run through Tailwind at all.
  `template.html` links it right after `scripts/styles.css`, so it loads
  second and can override a generated utility class if needed. Prefer this
  over adding more plain CSS into `tailwind-input.css`.
- **`scripts/styles.css`** is generated from `tailwind-input.css` — never
  hand-edit that file, only `tailwind-input.css` (or, for new hand-written
  classes, `scripts/custom.css` instead). After editing, run:
  ```
  npm run build:css     # one-off compile
  npm run watch:css     # recompiles on every save
  ```
  (run `npm install` first if `node_modules/` isn't present yet). Neither
  the WebHaste extension nor `.webhaste/compose.js` runs this build for
  you — if you change classes used in markup, `scripts/styles.css` is
  stale until you rebuild it, in the editor's preview and in any headless
  render alike.
- Tailwind's automatic content scanner skips dot-directories by default,
  which is exactly where this project's templates and blocks live.
  `tailwind-input.css` has explicit `@source "./.webhaste/templates";` and
  `@source "./.webhaste/blocks";` lines to cover that — if new markup gets
  added under another dot-prefixed path, it needs its own `@source` line or
  its classes silently never make it into `scripts/styles.css`.
- Watch out for a literal `*/` inside a `/* ... */` comment in
  `tailwind-input.css` (easy to write by accident when a comment lists
  several utility prefixes, e.g. "bg-*/text-*/border-*") — it closes the
  comment early, and everything after gets parsed as real CSS. This can
  corrupt parsing badly enough that unrelated, syntactically valid rules
  later in the file (like `@theme`) silently fail to register, surfacing as
  a confusing `Cannot apply unknown utility class` error far from the
  actual typo.

## Testing your changes (requires Node)

Page files are fragments (see above), so you can't just open one in a
browser to see the real result — it needs the template/nav/CSS-framework
substitution applied first. `.webhaste/compose.js` does exactly that,
headlessly, matching what the extension's "Render to Local Folder" /
Publish would produce:

```
node .webhaste/compose.js --out .agent-preview
```

This writes fully-composed pages (plus `assets/`/`scripts/`) into
`.agent-preview/` inside the project — use a scratch `--out` folder like
this rather than the real `dist/` (or whatever `deployDirectory` is set to)
so you don't clobber the site owner's actual build output. Delete the
scratch folder once you're done checking it; it's not meant to be committed.
Add `--packaged` to match what the **Packaged** deployment target produces
instead (root-relative paths rewritten to `../`-relative ones, search data
embedded per page, `sitemap.xml`/`robots.txt`/`404.html` omitted) — useful
for checking a page opens correctly via `file://` without installing the
extension. Run `node .webhaste/compose.js --help` for the full option list.

`compose.js` copies whatever is already in `scripts/styles.css` — it does
**not** run the Tailwind build, with `--packaged` or without. If you
changed any class names, run `npm run build:css` first (see "Tailwind
build step" above) or the preview you generate will be checking against
stale CSS.

If Node isn't available in this environment, fall back to reasoning from
the template's placeholders and this file's conventions — there's no other
way to render a page outside the extension itself.

## Do not hand-edit

- `dist/` (or whatever `deployDirectory` points at) — build output from
  "Render to Local Folder," overwritten on every render. This project's
  `.gitignore` excludes `dist/`, so a render never shows up in `git status`,
  and it isn't committed: Publish composes the site itself, so nothing here
  needs to exist ahead of time. If the Local Render Folder is changed in Site
  Settings, change the `dist/` line in `.gitignore` to match (unless the
  output is meant to be committed, e.g. `docs/` for GitHub Pages).
- `scripts/styles.css` — compiled from `tailwind-input.css` by
  `npm run build:css`/`watch:css`, see "Tailwind build step" above. Edit
  `tailwind-input.css`, never this file. Its sibling `scripts/custom.css`
  is the opposite — plain hand-written CSS, never touched by the build,
  safe (expected, even) to hand-edit.
- `.webhaste/compose.js`, `.webhaste/compose-core.js`, and
  `.webhaste/block-library.md` — regenerated every time the project
  folder is opened in the editor, so hand edits won't stick. (Unlike this
  file and `.webhaste/templates/`, which are copied in once and then left
  alone — edit those freely.)
- `.webhaste/` config files (`site.config.json`, `nav.json`, `pages.json`)
  are fine to hand-edit — that's the supported way to bulk-edit them — but
  keep the JSON valid. The editor doesn't validate on load, and a broken
  file falls back to defaults silently rather than erroring.
